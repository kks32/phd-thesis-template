# KNOWN ISSUES:
# * The following occurs:
#   file with: \usepackage{named}\bibliographystyle{named}
#   Compile
#   change to: \usepackage{apalike}\bibliographystyle{apalike}
#   Compile again -- BARF!
#
#   The workaround: make clean-nographics; make
#
#   Note that we may not be able to fix this.  LaTeX itself barfs
#   on this, not the makefile.  The very first invocation of LaTeX
#   (when something like this has happened) reads the existing .aux
#   file and discovers invalid commands like \citeauthoryear that
#   are only valid in the package that was just removed.  It then
#   tries to parse them and explodes.  It's not at all clear to me
#   how to fix this.  I tried removing the .aux files on the first
#   run of LaTeX, but that necessarily requires more subsequent
#   rebuilds on common edits.  There does not appear to be a
#   graceful solution to this issue.

#     - Backed out 2>&1 to &> (doesn't work in sh)
#     - Backed out using . to source variables
# Chris Monson (2010-03-22):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta7
# * Issue 72: Fix latex/bibtex invocation order for annotated bib styles
# * Fixed informational output to reflect which LaTeX run we're on
# * Fixed graphic detection to include graphics that are already there in
#     .d files
# * Tightened up the .d file output to only make .d depend on graphic
#     *source* files.  This means that building foo.d no longer
#     builds all of the graphics files on which foo.tex depends.
#     Had to use .SECONDEXPANSION trickery to make it work.
# * Changed get-graphics to only accept a stem.
# * Fixed build-once logic for scripted .tex to work better
# * Made get-inputs sed script more maintainable.
# * Moved Makefile.ini import up higher.
# * Changed bare stems to not recursively invoke make
# * Updated diff output to be more silent everywhere
# * Added a MISSING comment to the .d file if stuff isn't found - forces
#     removal of .1st.make file, which often forces it to try again.
# * Fixed broken graphics-target function
# * Added sleep to .d file generation when stuff is missing - if it
#     builds too fast, make doesn't realize it needs to be reloaded,
#     and thus never discovers some deeper dependencies (especially
#     evident when graphics are included from scripted include
#     files).
# Chris Monson (2010-03-17):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta6
# * Fixed bareword builds to actually work (requires static patterns)
# * Fixed colorization to work with new paragraph stuff
# Chris Monson (2010-03-17):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta5
# * Fixed graphic detection to be much more focused - splits log file
#     into paragraphs before doing pattern matching.
# * Fixed make foo to work properly (recursively calls make foo.pdf)
# * Fixed gpi -> pdf generation to not waste time building .eps *after*
#     the pdf already exists.
# * Changed log copies to include MAKE_RESTARTS as part of the name.
# * Fixed missing include file detection (also makes use of the paragraph
#     stuff) to detect missing scripted include files.
# Chris Monson (2010-03-16):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta4
# * issue 70: .pdf not moved out of the way properly on first
#     compilation, resulting in early error detection failure.
# * issue 74: fixed broken error on missing .aux files: the
#     implementation was masking real errors.
# Chris Monson (2010-03-15):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta3
# * issue 71: Made the tput dependency optional
# * issue 73: Made .tex targets not pull in .d files (building them from
#     scripts should not require a .d)
# * issue 74: Output a much saner error when a .aux file is not produced
#     (e.g., when you are typing "make" without arguments in a
#     directory with included .tex files that are not named with
#     ._include_.)
# Chris Monson (2010-03-11):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta2
# * Fixed clean-graphics to get rid of intermediate .eps files that may
#     be hanging around
# * Added an automatic setting to use eps terminals in pdflatex mode for
#     gnuplot if it doesn't understand pdf.
# * issue 66: Removed grayscale generation via magic suffix.  Grayscale
#     generation is now only available via GRAY=1
# * issue 68: Added explicit handling of LC_ALL for locale-aware tools
#     like "sort"
# Chris Monson (2010-03-10):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta1

# Chris Monson (2010-03-10):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-alpha3
# * Added meaningful error message for wrong hyperref options
# * Added meaningful error message for incorrect graphics extensions
# Chris Monson (2010-03-09):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-alpha2
# * Updated graphics handling (gnuplot and fig generate pdf natively)
# * Changed xmgrace to output monochrome natively
# Chris Monson (2010-03-09):
# * Bumped version to 2.2.0-alpha1 - major change!
# * Support pdflatex natively and by default (issue 6 - a long time coming)
# * Add ability to have a single $HOME/.latex-makefile/Makefile.ini for
#     all invocations
# * Reworked graphic inclusion detection so that extensions need not be
#     specified for either build strategy (e.g.,
#     \includegraphics{test1.eps} -> \includegrahpics{test1})
# * Changed log format to include filenames and line numbers
# Chris Monson (2010-02-04):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.43
# * All of the following are for issue 63 (thanks to mojoh81):
# * Added documentation about fixing Makefile.ini default target
# * Added perl and python script targets
# * Fixed run logic to allow included .tex files to be scripted (the
#     run-again logic now detects missing .tex files, and the MV
#     command has been switched out for a command that only invokes
#     MV if the files exist)
# * Changed scripted generation to only run once per make invocation
# * Added dependency on expr
# Chris Monson (2010-01-19):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.42
# * issue 62: Added .brf extension to cleanable files (backrefs)

# * Bumped version to 2.1.41
# * issue 60: bad makeindex runs now error out on subsequent tries

# Chris Monson (2009-11-23):

# * Bumped version to 2.1.32
# * Fixed so that a changed lol file will cause a rebuild
# * Added .lol files to the cleanable list

#     variables.
# * issue 28: support for png -> eps conversion (it even looks good!)

# Chris Monson (2009-03-09):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.24
# * issue 27: xmgrace support (thanks to rolandschulzhd)

# * Bumped version to 2.1.21

#     files that should *not* be considered includes.  Thanks to Holger
#     <yllohy@googlemail.com> for this patch.
# * Added an automatic include of Makefile.ini if it exists.  Allows
#     settings to be made outside of this makefile.
# Chris Monson (2008-05-21):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.20
# * Added manual pstex compilation support (run make all-pstex first)
# * Removed all automatic pstex support.  It was totally breaking
#     everything and is very hard to incorporate into the makefile
#     concept because it requires LaTeX to *fail* before it can
#     determine that it needs the files.
# Chris Monson (2008-04-17):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.19
# * Changed the pstex build hack to be on by default
# Chris Monson (2008-04-09):

#     gratuitious hack for testing: set PSTEX_BUILD_ALL_HACK=1.
# Chris Monson (2008-04-09):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.17
# * issue 20: fixed accumulation of <pid>*.make files - wildcard was

# * issue 19: Removed the use of "type" to fix broken "echo" settings

# * issue 9: Added .SECONDARY target for .pstex files
# Chris Monson (2008-03-21):
# * Bumped version to 2.1.14

#
# BSD SED NOTES
#
# BSD SED is not very nice compared to GNU sed, but it is the most
# commonly-invoked sed on Macs (being based on BSD), so we have to cater to
# it or require people to install GNU sed.  It seems like the GNU
# requirement isn't too bad since this makefile is really a GNU makefile,
# but apparently GNU sed is much less common than GNU make in general, so
# I'm supporting it here.
#
# Sad experience has taught me the following about BSD sed:
#
# 	* \+ is not understood to mean \{1,\}
# 	* \| is meaningless (does not branch)
# 	* \n cannot be used as a substitution character
# 	* ? does not mean \{0,1\}, but is literal
# 	* a\ works, but only reliably for a single line if subsequent lines
# 		have forward slashes in them (as is the case in postscript)
#
# For more info (on the Mac) you can consult
#
# man -M /usr/share/man re_format
#
# And look for the word "Obsolete" near the bottom.

# The name of the file containing special postscript commands for grayscale

# Changes sethsbcolor and setrgbcolor calls in postscript to always produce
# grayscale.  In general, this is accomplished by writing new versions of those
# functions into the user dictionary space, which is looked up before the
# global or system dictionaries (userdict is one of the permanent dictionaries
# in postscript and is not read-only like systemdict).
#
# For setrgbcolor, the weighted average of the triple is computed and the
# triple is replaced with three copies of that average before the original
# procedure is called: .299R + .587G + .114B
#
# For sethsbcolor, the color is first converted to RGB, then to grayscale by
# the new setrgbcolor operator as described above.  Why is this done?
# Because simply using the value component will tend to make pure colors
# white, a very undesirable thing.  Pure blue should not translate to white,
# but to some level of gray.  Conversion to RGB does the right thing.  It's
# messy, but it works.
#
# From
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space#Transformation_from_HSV_to_RGB,
# HSB = HSV (Value = Brightness), and the formula used to convert to RGB is
# as follows:
#
# Hi = int(floor(6 * H)) mod 6
# f = 6 * H - Hi
# p = V(1-S)
# q = V(1-fS)
# t = V(1-(1-f)S)
# if Hi = 0: R G B <-- V t p
# if Hi = 1: R G B <-- q V p
# if Hi = 2: R G B <-- p V t
# if Hi = 3: R G B <-- p q V
# if Hi = 4: R G B <-- t p V
# if Hi = 5: R G B <-- V p q
#

# finicky about what you call the actual files, but we can rest assured that if
# a .auxbbl.make file exists, then the .aux file does, as well.  The
# .auxbbl.make file is a cookie indicating whether the .bbl needs to be
# rewritten.  It only changes if the .aux file changes in ways relevant to .bbl
# creation.

# Note that we do NOT touch the .bbl file if there is no need to

#
# DEPENDENCY-RELATED TARGETS.
#

# Generate all of the information needed to get dependencies
# As a side effect, this creates a .dvi or .pdf file (depending on the build
# strategy).  We need to be sure to remove it if there are errors.  Errors can
# take several forms and all of them are found within the log file:
#	* There was a LaTeX error
#	* A needed file was not found
#	* Cross references need adjustment
#
# Behavior:
#	This rule is responsible for generating the following:
#	%.aux
#	%.d
#	%.aux.make
#	%.(pdf|dvi).1st.make (the .pdf or .dvi output file, moved)
#
#	Steps:
#
#	Run latex
#	Move .pdf or .dvi somewhere else (make no judgements about success)
#	Flatten the .aux file into another file
#	Add source dependencies
#	Add graphic dependencies
#	Add bib dependencies
#
#	Create cookies for various suffixes that may represent files that
#	need to be read by LaTeX in order for it to function properly.
#
#	Note that if some of the dependencies are discovered because they turn
#	up missing in the log file, we really need the .d file to be reloaded.
#	Adding a sleep command helps with this.  Otherwise make is extremely
#	nondeterministic, sometimes working, sometimes not.
#
#	Usually we can force this by simply removing the generated pdf file and
#	not creating a .1st.make file..

# Generates a number of possible output files from a LaTeX document and its
# various dependencies.  Handles .bib files, \include and \input, and .eps
# graphics.  All dependencies are handled automatically by running LaTeX over
# the source.
#
# USAGE:
#
#    make [GRAY=1] [VERBOSE=1] [SHELL_DEBUG=1] <target(s)>
#
# STANDARD OPTIONS:
#    GRAY:
#        Setting this variable forces all recompiled graphics to be grayscale.
#        It is useful when creating a document for printing.  The default is
#        to allow colors.  Note that it only changes graphics that need to be
#        rebuilt!  It is usually a good idea to do a 'make clean' first.
#
#    VERBOSE:
#        This turns off all @ prefixes for commands invoked by make.  Thus,
#        you get to see all of the gory details of what is going on.
#
#    SHELL_DEBUG:
#        This enables the -x option for sh, meaning that everything it does is
#        echoed to stderr.  This is particularly useful for debugging
#        what is going on in $$(shell ...) invocations.  One of my favorite
#        debugging tricks is to do this:
#
#        make -d SHELL_DEBUG=1 VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | less
#
#    KEEP_TEMP:
#        When set, this allows .make and other temporary files to stick around
#        long enough to do some debugging.  This can be useful when trying to
#        figure out why gnuplot is not doing the right things, for example
#        (e.g., look for *head.make).
#
# STANDARD AUXILIARY FILES:
#
#      Variables.ini (formerly Makefile.ini, which still works)
#
#          This file can contain variable declarations that override various
#          aspects of the makefile.  For example, one might specify
#
#          neverclean := *.pdf *.ps
#          onlysources.tex := main.tex
#          LATEX_COLOR_WARNING := 'bold red uline'
#
#          And this would override the neverclean setting to ensure that pdf
#          and ps files always remain behind, set the makefile to treat all
#          .tex files that are not "main.tex" as includes (and therefore not
#          default targets).  It also changes the LaTeX warning output to be
#          red, bold, and underlined.
#
#          There are numerous variables in this file that can be overridden in
#          this way.  Search for '?=' to find them all.
#
#          The Variables.ini is imported before *anything else* is done, so go
#          wild with your ideas for changes to this makefile in there.  It
#          makes it easy to test them before submitting patches.
#
#          If you're adding rules or targets, however, see Targets.ini below.
#
#      Targets.ini
#
#          This is included much later in the makefile, after all variables and
#          targets are defined.  This is where you would put new make rules,
#          e.g.,
#
#          generated.tex: generating_script.weird_lang depA depB
#             ./generating_script.weird_lang > $$@
#
#          In this file, you have access to all of the variables that the
#          makefile creates, like $$(onlysources.tex).  While accessing those can
#          be somewhat brittle (they are implementation details and may change),
#          it is a great way to test your ideas when submitting feature requests.
#
# STANDARD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
#
#      LATEX_COLOR_WARNING        '$(LATEX_COLOR_WARNING)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_ERROR          '$(LATEX_COLOR_ERROR)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_UNDERFULL      '$(LATEX_COLOR_UNDERFULL)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_OVERFULL       '$(LATEX_COLOR_OVERFULL)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_PAGES          '$(LATEX_COLOR_PAGES)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_BUILD          '$(LATEX_COLOR_BUILD)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_GRAPHIC        '$(LATEX_COLOR_GRAPHIC)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_DEP            '$(LATEX_COLOR_DEP)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_SUCCESS        '$(LATEX_COLOR_SUCCESS)'
#      LATEX_COLOR_FAILURE        '$(LATEX_COLOR_FAILURE)'
#
#   These may be redefined in your environment to be any of the following:
#
#      black
#      red
#      green
#      yellow
#      blue
#      magenta
#      cyan
#      white
#
#   Bold or underline may be used, as well, either alone or in combination
#   with colors:
#
#      bold
#      uline
#
#   Order is not important.  You may want, for example, to specify:
#
#   export LATEX_COLOR_SUCCESS='bold blue uline'
#
#   in your .bashrc file.  I don't know why, but you may want to.
#
# STANDARD TARGETS:
#
#    all:
#        Make all possible documents in this directory.  The documents are
#        determined by scanning for .tex and .tex.sh (described in more detail
#        later) and omitting any file that ends in ._include_.tex or
#        ._nobuild_.tex.  The output is a set of .pdf files.
#
#        If you wish to omit files without naming them with the special
#        underscore names, set the following near the top of the Makefile,
#        or (this is recommended) within a Makefile.ini in the same directory:
#
#         includes.tex := file1.tex file2.tex
#
#        This will cause the files listed to be considered as include files.
#
#        If you have only few source files, you can set
#
#         onlysources.tex := main.tex
#
#        This will cause only the source files listed to be considered in
#        dependency detection.  All other .tex files will be considered as
#        include files.  Note that these options work for *any* source type,
#        so you could do something similar with includes.gpi, for example.
#        Note that this works for *any valid source* target.  All of the
#        onlysources.* variables are commented out in the shipping version of
#        this file, so it does the right thing when they simply don't exist.
#        The comments are purely documentation.  If you know, for example, that
#        file.mycoolformat is supported by this Makefile, but don't see the
#        "onlysources.mycoolformat" declared in the comments, that doesn't mean
#        you can't use it.  Go ahead and set "onlysources.mycoolformat" and it
#        should do the right thing.
#
#    show:
#        Builds and displays all documents in this directory.  It uses the
#        environment-overridable value of VIEW_PDF (currently $(VIEW_PDF)) to
#        do its work.
#
#    all-graphics:
#        Make all of the graphics in this directory.
#
#    all-pstex (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
#        Build all fig files into pstex and pstex_t files.  Gray DOES NOT WORK.
#
#    all-gray-pstex (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
#          Build all fig files into grayscale pstex and pstex_t files.
#
#    all-dot2tex:
#          Build all dot files into tex files.
#
#    show-graphics:
#        Builds and displays all graphics in this directory.  Uses the
#        environment-overridable value of VIEW_GRAPHICS (currently
#        $(VIEW_GRAPHICS)) to do its work.
#
#    clean:
#        Remove ALL generated files, leaving only source intact.
#        This will *always* skip files mentioned in the "neverclean" variable,
#        either in this file or specified in Makefile.ini:
#
#         neverclean := *.pdf *.ps
#
#       The neverclean variable works on all "clean" targets below, as well.
#
#    clean-graphics:
#        Remove all generated graphics files.
#
#    clean-backups:
#        Remove all backup files: $(backup_patterns)
#        (XFig and other editors have a nasty habit of leaving them around)
#        Also removes Makefile-generated .temp files
#
#    clean-tex:
#        Remove all files generated from LaTeX invocations except dependency
#        information.  Leaves graphics alone.
#
#    clean-deps:
#        Removes all auto-generated dependency information.
#
#    clean-auxiliary:
#        Removes extra files created by various targets (like the dependency
#        graph output).
#
#    clean-nographics:
#        Cleans everything *except* the graphics files.
#
#    help:
#        This help text.
#
#    version:
#        Version information about this LaTeX makefile.
#
# DEBUG TARGETS:
#
#    _all_programs:
#        A list of the programs used by this makefile.
#
#    _check_programs:
#        Checks your system for the needed software and reports what it finds.
#
#    _check_gpi_files:
#        Checks the .gpi files in the current directory for common errors, such
#        as specification of the terminal or output file inside of the gpi file
#        itself.
#
#    _dependency_graph:
#        Outputs a .dot file to stdout that represents a graph of LaTeX
#        dependencies.  To see it, use the _show_dependency_graph target or
#        direct the output to a file, run dot on it, and view the output, e.g.:
#
#        make _dependency_graph > graph.dot
#        dot -T ps -o graph.eps graph.dot
#        gv graph.eps
#
#    _show_dependency_graph:
#        Makes viewing the graph simple: extracts, builds and displays the
#        dependency graph given in the _dependency_graph target using the value
#        of the environment-overridable VIEW_POSTSCRIPT variable (currently set
#        to $(VIEW_POSTSCRIPT)).  The postscript viewer is used because it
#        makes it easier to zoom in on the graph, a critical ability for
#        something so dense and mysterious.
#
#    _all_sources:
#        List all .tex files in this directory.
#
#    _sources:
#        Print out a list of all compilable sources in this directory.  This is
#        useful for determining what make thinks it will be using as the
#        primary source for 'make all'.
#
#    _scripts:
#        Print out a list of scripts that make knows can be used to generate
#        .tex files (described later).
#
#    _all_stems:
#        Print a list of stems.  These represent bare targets that can be
#        executed.  Listing <stem> as a bare target will produce <stem>.pdf.
#
#    _includes:
#        A list of .d files that would be included in this run if _includes
#        weren't specified.  This target may be used alone or in conjunction
#        with other targets.
#
#    _graphic_outputs:
#        A list of all generated .eps files
#
#    _env:
#        A list of environment variables and their values.  If supported by
#        your version of make, also a list of variables known to make.
#
# FILE TARGETS:
#
#    %, %.pdf:
#        Build a PDF file from the corresponding %.tex file.
#
#        If BUILD_STRATEGY=pdflatex, then this builds the pdf directly.
#        Otherwise, it uses this old-school but effective approach:
#
#            latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf
#
#        The BUILD_STRATEGY can be overridden in Makefile.ini in the same
#        directory.  The default is pdflatex.
#
#        Reasons for using latex -> dvips include the "psfrag" package, and the
#        generation of postscript instead of PDF.  Arguments for using pdflatex
#        include "new and shiny" and "better supported."  I can't argue with
#        either of those, and supporting them both didn't turn out to be that
#        difficult, so there you have it.  Choices.
#
#    %._show:
#        A phony target that builds the pdf file and then displays it using the
#        environment-overridable value of VIEW_PDF ($(VIEW_PDF)).
#
#    %._graphics:
#        A phony target that generates all graphics on which %.pdf (or %.dvi)
#        depends.
#
#    %.ps (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
#        Build a Postscript file from the corresponding %.tex file.
#        This is done using dvips.  Paper size is automatically
#        extracted from the declaration
#
#        \documentclass[<something>paper]
#
#        or it is the system default.
#
#        If using beamer (an excellent presentation class), the paper
#        size is ignored.  More on this later.
#
#    %.dvi (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
#        Build the DVI file from the corresponding %.tex file.
#
#    %.ind:
#        Build the index for this %.tex file.
#
#    %.gls:
#        Build the nomenclature glossary for this %.tex file.
#
#    %.nls:
#        Build the (newer) nomenclature file for this %.tex file.
#
#    %.eps:
#        Build an eps file from one of the following file types:
#
#       .dot    : graphviz
#       .gpi    : gnuplot
#       .fig    : xfig
#       .xvg    : xmgrace
#       .svg    : scalable vector graphics (goes through inkscape)
#       .png    : png (goes through NetPBM)
#       .jpg      : jpeg (goes through ImageMagick)
#       .eps.gz : gzipped eps
#
#       The behavior of this makefile with each type is described in
#       its own section below.
#
#    %.pstex{,_t} (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
#       Build a .pstex_t file from a .fig file.
#
# FEATURES:
#
#    Optional Binary Directory:
#        If you create the _out_ directory in the same place as the makefile,
#        it will automatically be used as a dumping ground for .pdf (or .dvi,
#        .ps, and .pdf) output files.
#
#        Alternatively, you can set the BINARY_TARGET_DIR variable, either as a
#        make argument or in Makefile.ini, to point to your directory of
#        choice.  Note that no pathname wildcard expansion is done in the
#        makefile, so make sure that the path is complete before going in
#        there.  E.g., if you want to specify something in your home directory,
#        use $$HOME/ instead of ~/ so that the shell expands it before it gets
#        to the makefile.
#
#    External Program Dependencies:
#        Every external program used by the makefile is represented by an
#        ALLCAPS variable at the top of this file.  This should allow you to
#        make judgments about whether your system supports the use of this
#        makefile.  The list is available in the ALL_PROGRAMS variable and,
#        provided that you are using GNU make 3.80 or later (or you haven't
#        renamed this file to something weird like "mylatexmakefile" and like
#        invoking it with make -f) can be viewed using
#
#        make _all_programs
#
#        Additionally, the availability of these programs can be checked
#        automatically for you by running
#
#        make _check_programs
#
#        The programs are categorized according to how important they are and
#        what function they perform to help you decide which ones you really
#        need.
#
#    Colorized Output:
#        The output of commands is colorized to highlight things that are often
#        important to developers.  This includes {underfull,overfull}
#        {h,v}boxes, general LaTeX Errors, each stage of document building, and
#        the number of pages in the final document.  The colors are obtained
#        using 'tput', so colorization should work pretty well on any terminal.
#
#        The colors can be customized very simply by setting any of the
#        LATEX_COLOR_<CONTEXT> variables in your environment (see above).
#
#    Predecessors to TeX Files:
#        Given a target <target>, if no <target>.tex file exists but a
#        corresponding script or predecessor file exists, then appropriate
#        action will be taken to generate the tex file.
#
#        Currently supported script or predecessor languages are:
#
#        sh:     %.tex.sh
#        perl:   %.tex.pl
#        python: %.tex.py
#
#           Calls the script using the appropriate interpreter, assuming that
#           its output is a .tex file.
#
#           The script is called thus:
#
#              <interpreter> <script file name> <target tex file>
#
#           and therefore sees exactly one parameter: the name of the .tex
#           file that it is to create.
#
#           Why does this feature exist?  I ran into this while working on
#           my paper dissertation.  I wrote a huge bash script that used a
#           lot of sed to bring together existing papers in LaTeX.  It
#           would have been nice had I had something like this to make my
#           life easier, since as it stands I have to run the script and
#           then build the document with make.  This feature provides hooks
#           for complicated stuff that you may want to do, but that I have
#           not considered.  It should work fine with included dependencies,
#           too.
#
#           Scripts are run every time make is invoked.  Some trickery is
#           employed to make sure that multiple restarts of make don't cause
#           them to be run again.
#
#        reST: %.rst
#
#           Runs the reST to LaTeX converter to generate a .tex file
#           If it finds a file names _rststyle_._include_.tex, uses it as
#           the "stylesheet" option to rst2latex.
#
#           Note that this does not track sub-dependencies in rst files.  It
#           assumes that the top-level rst file will change if you want a
#           rebuild.
#
#       literate Haskell: %.lhs
#
#           Runs the lhs2tex program to generate a .tex file.
#
#    Dependencies:
#
#        In general, dependencies are extracted directly from LaTeX output on
#        your document.  This includes
#
#        *    Bibliography information
#        *    \include or \input files (honoring \includeonly, too)
#        *    Graphics files inserted by the graphicx package
#
#        Where possible, all of these are built correctly and automatically.
#        In the case of graphics files, these are generated from the following
#        file types:
#
#        GraphViz:      .dot
#        GNUPlot:       .gpi
#        XFig:          .fig
#        XMgrace:       .xvg
#        SVG:           .svg
#        PNG:           .png
#        JPEG:          .jpg
#        GZipped EPS:   .eps.gz
#
#        If the file exists as a .eps already, it is merely used (and will not
#        be deleted by 'clean'!).
#
#        LaTeX and BibTeX are invoked correctly and the "Rerun to get
#        cross-references right" warning is heeded a reasonable number of
#        times.  In my experience this is enough for even the most troublesome
#        documents, but it can be easily changed (if LaTeX has to be run after
#        BibTeX more than three times, it is likely that something is moving
#        back and forth between pages, and no amount of LaTeXing will fix
#        that).
#
#        \includeonly is honored by this system, so files that are not
#        specified there will not trigger a rebuild when changed.
#
#    Beamer:
#        A special TeX source comment is recognized by this makefile (only when
#        BUILD_STRATEGY=latex, since this invokes psnup):
#
#        %%[[:space:]]*BEAMER[[:space:]]*LARGE
#
#        The presence of this comment forces the output of dvips through psnup
#        to enlarge beamer slides to take up an entire letter-sized page.  This
#        is particularly useful when printing transparencies or paper versions
#        of the slides.  For some reason landscape orientation doesn't appear
#        to work, though.
#
#        If you want to put multiple slides on a page, use this option and then
#        print using mpage, a2ps, or psnup to consolidate slides.  My personal
#        favorite is a2ps, but your mileage may vary.
#
#        When beamer is the document class, dvips does NOT receive a paper size
#        command line attribute, since beamer does special things with sizes.
#
#    GNUPlot Graphics:
#        When creating a .gpi file, DO NOT INCLUDE the "set terminal" or "set
#        output" commands!  The makefile will include terminal information for
#        you.  Besides being unnecessary and potentially harmful, including the
#        terminal definition in the .gpi file makes it harder for you, the one
#        writing the document, to preview your graphics, e.g., with
#
#           gnuplot -persist myfile.gpi
#
#        so don't do specify a terminal or an output file in your .gpi files.
#
#        When building a gpi file into an eps file, there are several features
#        available to the document designer:
#
#        Global Header:
#            The makefile searches for the files in the variable GNUPLOT_GLOBAL
#            in order:
#
#            ($(GNUPLOT_GLOBAL))
#
#            Only the first found is used.  All .gpi files in the directory are
#            treated as though the contents of GNUPLOT_GLOBAL were directly
#            included at the top of the file.
#
#            NOTE: This includes special comments! (see below)
#
#        Font Size:
#            A special comment in a .gpi file (or a globally included file) of
#            the form
#
#            ## FONTSIZE=<number>
#
#            will change the font size of the GPI output.  If font size is
#            specified in both the global file and the GPI file, the
#            specification in the individual GPI file is used.
#
#        Grayscale Output:
#            GNUplot files also support a special comment to force them to be
#            output in grayscale *no matter what*:
#
#            ## GRAY
#
#            This is not generally advisable, since you can always create a
#            grayscale document using the forms mentioned above.  But, if your
#            plot simply must be grayscale even in a document that allows
#            colors, this is how you do it.
#
#    XFig Graphics:
#            No special handling is done with XFig, except when a global
#            grayscale method is used, e.g.
#
#                make GRAY=1 document
#
#            In these cases the .eps files is created using the -N switch to
#            fig2dev to turn off color output.  (Only works with eps, not pstex
#            output)
#
#    GraphVis Graphics:
#            Color settings are simply ignored here.  The 'dot' program is used
#            to transform a .dot file into a .eps file.
#
#            If you want, you can use the dot2tex program to convert dot files
#            to tex graphics.  The default is to just call dot2tex with no
#            arguments, but you can change the DOT2TEX definition to include
#            options as needed (in your Makefile.ini).
#
#            Note that, as with pstex, the makefile cannot use latex's own
#            output to discover all missing dot_t (output) files, since anytime
#            TeX includes TeX, it has to bail when it can't find the include
#            file.  It can therefore only stop on the first missing file it
#            discovers, and we can't get a large list of them out easily.
#
#            So, the makefile errors out if it's missing an included dot_t
#            file, then prompts the user to run this command manually:
#
#                make all-dot2tex
#
#    GZipped EPS Graphics:
#
#        A .eps.gz file is sometimes a nice thing to have.  EPS files can get
#        very large, especially when created from bitmaps (don't do this if you
#        don't have to).  This makefile will unzip them (not in place) to
#        create the appropriate EPS file.
