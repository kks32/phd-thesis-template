%% * USAGE: * 
% 
% *Requirements/overview:* 
% 
% The package is made for the background of the LaTeX2e macro 
% package and enhances functionality of the following packages: 
% 1.) Stephan I. B"ottcher's `lineno.sty' for printing line 
%     numbers in the margin and a \label version \linelabel 
%     relating labels to line numbers; 
% 2.) our `ednotes.sty' for indicating variant readings and 
%     other editorial remarks in separate footnote apparatuses; 
% 3.) David Carlisle's `longtable.sty' for multi-page tables. 
%                                                 %% TODO: supertabular etc.!? 
% 4.) our `ltabptch.sty' for a patch of `longtable.sty' 
%     (i.e., optionally, see below). 
% 
% Actually, only the first package is necessary for using the 
% present one. The present one needs your line numbering commands 
% according to the first one and its documentation to which we 
% refer here. We likewise refer to the remaining packages for the 
% details of their functionality. 
% 
% `lineno.sty' version 4.1 and (in case it is used) `ednotes.sty' 
% version 0.8 (onwards) are needed. For obtaining recent versions 
% of required packages, see the CTAN folder 
%     /macros/latex/contrib/ednotes. 
% 
% *Install/load:* 
% 1.) To be used, the present file must be put into a folder 
%     that (La)TeX searches. You should have obtained a file 
%     containing more detailed hints about this. 
% 2.) We recommend loading this file *not* by 
%     \usepackage[<options>]{edtable} but by loading `lineno.sty' 
%     or `ednotes.sty' with package option `edtable'. 
% 3.) To use the package options `longtable' and 
%     `nolongtablepatch' that are described below, enter them 
%     as options for `lineno.sty' or `ednotes.sty'. 
% 
% *User Commands:* 
% 
% 1. The package defines an environment `edtable' -- for its 
% syntax we consider two cases: 
% (a) Let <stdtable> be a tabular environment "like `tabular'". 
% "Like" here means: (i) we have tested it with `tabular', but 
% it should work with many more (e.g., from the `array' and 
% `tabularx' packages) -- which share certain properties of 
% implementation and requirements. Sorry, you must try, or we 
% hope you will (and tell us). (For wizards: <stdtable> may 
% probably be anything using a single \halign and \tabskip=0pt.) 
% Definitively: 
% (ii) LaTeX's standard `array' and other environments are *not* 
% "like" `tabular'. Namely, environments that work only in math 
% mode are not meant here. They are considered below in `b.'. 
% (iii) `longtable' from the `longtable' package of the `tools' 
% bundle neither is meant. An option of the present package 
% deals with it as described below. Neither `supertabular' is 
% meant. 
% (iv) In general, usage with tabular environments that can 
% break across pages as in (iii) is not recommended, at least 
% when working with `ednotes.sty'. Even if some worked here, a 
% shortcoming with `ednotes.sty' would be that the footnotes can 
% appear on bad pages. 
% -- Now the syntax is: 
%    \begin{edtable}{<stdtable>}<args><entries>\end{edtable}
% -- where <args> and <entries> are usual arguments and entries 
% for <stdtable>. So an example is: 
%    \begin{edtable}{tabular}{cc} 
%      left upper & right upper \\ left lower & right lower 
%    \end{edtable} 
% This produces just what <stdtable> does in an extra line, 
% only adding line numbers in the margin and processing `ednotes' 
% commands in the entries appropriately. 
% (b) Let <stdarray> be an "array environment" like -- standard 
% LaTeX's `array'! "Like" here means (i) ... analogously to 
% <stdtable> above. (ii) "Text" ... oh, sorry, this is not clear 
% to me at present, and I am in a hurry.                 %% TODO 
% (iii) Nothing from the `amsmath' package seems to work here, 
% sorry, I have tried a lot ... (iv) For standard LaTeX's 
% `eqnarray', it is better to try the `linenomath' environment 
% of `lineno.sty' [with package option `mathlines']. Its 
% modifications in `amsmath' produce (at best) a spurious line 
% number with the `linenomath' environment (up to now). 
% -- Now the syntax is: 
%    \begin{edtable}[<$$$>]{<stdarray>}
%      <args><entries>\end{edtable}
% -- where <args> and <entries> are usual arguments and entries 
% for <stdarray>. <$$$> can be one of `$' or `$$'. Indeed, the 
% <stdtable> syntax above (without [<$$$>]) *does not work* 
% inside $...$ or $$...$$. -- An example: 
%    \begin{edtable}[$$]{array}{cc}
%      a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22}
%    \end{edtable}
% Now, this produces just what <stdarray> does in an extra line 
% etc. as with <stdtable>. However, \linelabel and `ednotes.sty' 
% footnotes may need the `mathrefs' option of `lineno.sty'. For 
% the difference between `[$]' and `[$$]', see below. 
% 
% 2. When working with `ednotes.sty', in 
%   \Anote{L1\<L2\>L3}{NOTE}
% L2 may contain &'s and \\'s, but L1, L3 must not! Analogously 
% for \Bnote, etc., \Anotelabel...\donote..., etc. -- Well this 
% holds for <stdtable>, hardly for <stdarray> ...        %% TODO 
% 
% 3. On positioning: You may have wondered about `extra line' 
% above. This means that `edtable' starts a new line at 
% \begin{edtable} and at \end{edtable}.          %% TODO: sure!? 
% (a) It should be placed within a `center', `flushleft', or 
% `flushright' environment for proper (vertical) spacing, but 
% also works without. However, with <stdarray> and optional 
% parameter `$$' of `edtable' (i.e., \begin{edtable}[$$]...), 
% you can obtain the usual math display spacing *within a 
% paragraph*; especially, the vertical space is less when the 
% previous line is short ... and so on. 
% (b) Horizontal positioning of line numbers (usually) needs a 
% second run (after changing a table)! %% TODO: automatic warning. 
% (For wizards: It may fail if some of \leftskip, \rightskip, 
% \linewidth, and \@totalleftmargin are used in an unusual way.) 
% A <dimen> register \ETextraoffset is provided whose value is 
% 0pt by default and which additionally moves line numbers 
% to the left (right) if given a positive (negative) value. 
%                                               %% TODO: any use? 
% 
% *Package options:* 
% 
% 1. Option `longtable' adjusts the `longtable' environment 
% defined by David Carlisle's longtable.sty for use with 
% `lineno.sty' and `ednotes.sty'. The option makes `longtable' 
% environments appear with line numbers in the margin, according 
% to `lineno.sty', and process `ednotes.sty' commands if line 
% numbering is active according to `lineno.sty'. 
% [We maintain an alternative package with just this function 
% in a slightly different implementation.] %% -> ulnltab.sty. 
% Lemmas may go across table entries as with `edtable' (see above). 
% ---There might be options like `supertabular' for adjusting 
% other tabular environments that cannot be handled by the 
% `edtable' environment provided here---they have not been 
% implemented yet!                                             %% TODO 
% 
% 2. Option `nolongtablepatch' avoids loading/asking for 
% `ltabptch.sty'. I.e.: according to LaTeX bugs database, 
% tools/3180 and tools/3485, there have been problems with 
% vertical spacing around `longtable' environments. By default 
% the present package loads our `ltabptch.sty' or asks for it. 
% Option `nolongtablepatch' overrides this. This is useful when 
% you don't want to have the patch, especially when you use an 
% "emergency stop" installation of TeX. 
% 
% *Wizard interface:* 
% Macros \@ET@makeLineNumber, \@ET@use@outerhook, 
% \@ET@execute@outerhook, \@ET@ampnotes \@ET@startlinewith, 
% \@ET@trivialize@linelabel are provided as tools for adjusting 
% tabular environments for use with `lineno.sty' and 
% `ednotes.sty'. \@ET@step@linenumber is \let \stepLineNumber 
% (from `lineno.sty'), but could be used as a hook for 
% something different. See Environment `edtable' and Option 
% `longtable' below for examples of application. 
%                                        %% TODO: specification here. 
% 
%
%% * Acknowledgements: * 
% 
% Stephan I. B"ottcher told us how to do it in extensive discussion 
% and by providing some first code lines. We changed these essentially 
% in some respects, but kept his general ideas and some parts of his 
% macros, the latter even without knowing what we are doing. 
% 
% v1.3 is due to a request by Martin Brandenburg. 
% 
%  * Now for internals: *

\ProvidesPackage{edtable}[\filedate\space v\fileversion\space 
  arrays with lineno + ednotes (ul)] 
% 
% Alternative ideas for implementation: 
% 1. There is a German package `TABMAC' enhancing `EDMAC' (cf. 
% documentation of `ednotes.sty'). We could have rewritten its 
% macros so it would work with `lineno.sty' and `ednotes.sty' 
% in place of `EDMAC'. [TODO: "tabmac.sty"] 
% 2. We redefine `longtable' by Option `longtable' because 
% there seems to be only one reasonable use of the `longtable' 
% environment in the course of a critical edition. This may be 
% different for environments like `array' and `tabular' which 
% can be used within text lines. Therefore, these environments 
% are not redefined. 
% 3. One might use \everycr, however: (a) it is executed 
% before the first row, (b) it is executed in fake lines that 
% `longtable' uses. 
% 4. As an alternative to \everycr, there is the approach of 
% redefining \cr and \crcr for setting \noalign. This needs 
% redefining \@tabularcr etc.---not nice. We use this approach 
% here for `longtable' which uses a stretching \tabskip. 
% For \tabskip=0pt, we attach line numbers by a template.

  % Stephan's direction for attaching a line number to each row

  % However, (1) the user should not worry about closing the table 
  % with \\ or without, and (2) the line number thing should not 
  % happen twice if \\ is the last token before \end{longtable}. 
  % Our solution: attach something to the beginning of \endlongtable 
  % which attaches line number unless an unsucceeded \\ has done it. 
  % This thing is activated by each row start and turned off by \\. 
  % Since the switch at row start may happen to be in a pbox, 
  % let it act globally on \endlongtable. (The \crcr at the beginning 
  % of \endlongtable must not be changed directly, since original 
  % \crcr may be required in table entries using \oalign etc.)

                  moved redefinition \LT@get@widths from option code 
                  into \@ET@longtable so this really happens in 
                  line number mode only; moved \let\@ET@@halign\halign

                  Removed `may be released under different name'. 
v1.10 2004/07/27  Looking for `longtabl.sty' for my Atari!

                  removed `preliminary release'. 
      2004/10/06  \newif -> \let...; option `nolongtablepatch'; 
                  changed documentation accordingly and for 
                  loading edtable.sty by lineno/ednotes option; 
                  \let\@ET@step@linenumber\stepLineNumber; use 
                  \ifLineNumbers. 
      2004/10/07  Needed version numbers. 
      2004/10/08  ltabptch warning -> error! 
      2004/10/11  Disabled \RequirePackage{lineno}[...]; undid 
                  the `longtabl.sty' thing from 2004/07/27.

v1.3b 2005/03/04  Support for environments like `array' 
                  environment. The description of `edtable' was 
                  wrong in this respect! 
v1.3  2005/03/07  Adaptations in documentation, and extended usage 
                  instructions very much, correcting some 
                  errors as well. Acknowledgement to M. B.
