## Building your thesis

### Using the Make File (Unix/Linux)

The template supports PDF, DVI and PS formats. All three formats can be generated
with the provided `Makefile`.

To build the `PDF` version of your thesis, run:

    make


This build procedure uses `pdflatex` and will produce `thesis.pdf`.

To produce `DVI` and `PS` versions of your document, you should run:


    make BUILD_STRATEGY=latex

This will use the `latex` command to build the document and will produce
`thesis.dvi`, `thesis.ps` and `thesis.pdf` documents. You will need psutils installed

Clean unwanted files

To clean unwanted clutter (all LaTeX auto-generated files), run:

    make clean

__Note__: the `Makefile` itself is take from and maintained at
[here](http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/).

### Shell script for PDFLaTeX (Unix/Linux)

Usage: `sh ./compile-thesis.sh [OPTIONS] [filename]`

[option]  compile: Compiles the PhD Thesis

[option]  clean: removes temporary files - no filename required

### Using the Batch file on Windows (PDFLaTeX)

*    Open command prompt and navigate to the directory with the tex file. Run:
    
    `compile-thesis-windows.bat`.

*    Alternatively, double click on `compile-thesis-windows.bat`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage details

Thesis information such as title, author, year, degree, etc., and other meta-data can be modified in `thesis-info.tex`

### Class Options

The class file, `PhDThesisPSnPDF`, is based on the standard `book` class

It supports the following custom options in the documentclass in thesis.tex:

(Usage `\documentclass[a4paper,11pt,print]{Classes/PhDThesisPSnPDF}`)

*   `a4paper` (default as per the University guidelines) or `a5paper`: Paper size

*   `11pt` or `12pt`: The University of Cambridge guidelines recommend using a minimum font size of 11pt (12pt is preferred) and 10pt for footnotes. This template also supports `10pt`.

*   `oneside` or `twoside` (default): This is especially useful for printing double side (twoside) or single side.

*   `print`: Supports Print and Online Version with different page margins and hyperlink styles.
    Use `print` in the options to activate Print Version with appropriate margins and page layout and view styles. 
    Leaving the options field blank will activate Online version.

*   `custommargin`: You can alter the margin dimension for both print and online version by using the keyword `custommargin` in the options. Then you can define the dimensions of the margin in the `preamble.tex` file: 

        \ifsetMargin
        \else
        \RequirePackage[left=37mm,right=30mm,top=35mm,bottom=30mm]{geometry} 
        \setFancyHdr
        \fi
    `\setFancyHdr` should be called when using custom margins for proper header/footer dimensions


*   `index`: Including this option builds the index, which is placed at the end of the thesis.

    Instructions on how to use the index can be found [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing#Using_makeidx).

    _Note_: the package `makeidx` is used to create the index.
    
*   `abstract`: This option enables only the thesis title page and the abstract with title and author to be printed. 

*   `chapter`: This option enables only the specified chapter and it's references. Useful for review and corrections.


### Abstract separate

*  A separate abstract with the title of the PhD and the candidate name has to be submitted to the Student Registry. This can be generated using `abstract` option in the document class. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file: 

        \ifdefineAbstract
        \includeonly{Abstract/abstract}
        \else
        \fi

### Chapter Mode

*  The chapter mode allows user to only print specific chapters along with references. By default, it excludes everything else in the front matter and appendices. This can done by using `chapter` option in the document class in `thesis.tex`. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file: 

		\ifdefineChapter
			\includeonly{Chapter3/chapter3} 
		\else
		\fi


### Choosing the Fonts

`PhDThesisPSnPDF` currently supports three fonts `Times`, `Fourier` and `Latin Modern (default)`.

*   `times`: (The University of Cambridge guidelines recommend using Times). Specifying times option in the document class will use `mathptpx` or `Times` font with Math Support.
*   `fourier`: fourier font with math support
*   `default (empty)`: When no font is specified, `Latin Modern` is used as the default font with Math Support. 
*   `customfont`: Any custom font can be set in preamble by using `customfont` option in the document class. Then the custom font can be loaded in preamble.tex in the line:

		\ifsetFont
		\else 
		\RequirePackage{Your_Custom_Font}
		\fi

### Choosing the Bibliography style

`PhDThesisPSnPDF` currently supports two styles `authoryear` and `numbered (default)`. Citation style has to be set. You can also specify `custombib` style and customise the bibliography.

* `authoryear`: For author-year citation eg., Krishna (2013)

* `numbered`: (Default Option) For numbered and sorted citation e.g., [1,5,2]

* `custombib`: Define your own bibliography style in the `preamble.tex` file.

		\RequirePackage[square, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}

* (Overview of Bibtex-Styles with preview)[http://nodonn.tipido.net/bibstyle.php?]

* If you would like to use biblatex instead of natbib. Pass the option `custombib` in the documentclass. In the `preamble.tex` file, edit the custombib section. Make sure you don't load the natbib package and you can specify the layout of your references in `thesis.tex` in the reference section. If you are using `biber` as backend, run `pdflatex thesis.tex >> biber thesis >> pdflatex thesis.tex >> biber thesis >> pdflatex thesis.tex`. If you are using the default natbib package, don't worry about this.

### Choosing the Page Style

`PhDThesisPSnPDF` defines 3 different page styles (header and footer). The following definition is for `twoside` layout.

* `default (leave empty)`: For Page Numbers in Header (Left Even, Right Odd) and Chapter Name in Header (Right Even) and Section #. Section Name (Left Odd). Blank Footer.

        Header (Even)   : 4                                                 Introduction 

        Header (Odd)    : 1.2 Section Name 		   			                5

        Footer 		    : Empty

* `PageStyleI`: For Page Numbers in Header (Left Even, Right Odd) and Chapter Name next to the Page Number on Even Side (Left Even). Section Number and Section Name and Page Number in Header on Odd Side (Right Odd). Footer is empty. Layout:

        Header (Even)   : 4 | Introduction 

        Header (Odd)    :                         			                1.2 Section Name | 5

        Footer 		    :                               Empty

* `PageStyleII`: Chapter Name on Even Side (Left Even) in Header. Section Number and Section Name in Header on Odd Side (Right Odd). Page numbering in footer. Layout:

        Header (Even)   : Introduction
        
        Header (Odd)    : 			   				                        1.2 Section Name
        
        Footer[centered]:                           	3

### Changing the visual style of chapter headings

The visual style of chapter headings can be modified using the `titlesec` package. Edit the following lines in the `preamble.tex` file.

        \RequirePackage{titlesec}
        \newcommand{\PreContentTitleFormat}{\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\scshape\Large}
        {\Large\filleft{\chaptertitlename} \Huge\thechapter}
        {1ex}{}
        [\vspace{1ex}\titlerule]}
        \newcommand{\ContentTitleFormat}{\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\scshape\huge}
        {\Large\filleft{\chaptertitlename} \Huge\thechapter}{1ex}
        {\titlerule\vspace{1ex}\filright}
        [\vspace{1ex}\titlerule]}
        \newcommand{\PostContentTitleFormat}{\PreContentTitleFormat}
        \PreContentTitleFormat

### Custom Settings

*   The depth for the table of contents can be set using: 

        \setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
	    \setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
    A depth of [3] indicates to a level of `\subsubsection` or #.#.#.#. Default set as 2.

*   To hide sections from appearing in TOC use: `\tochide\section{Section name}` in your TeX files

*   Define custom caption style for figure and table caption in `preamble.tex` using:

        \RequirePackage[small,bf,figurename=Fig.,labelsep=space,tableposition=top]{caption}

*   Bibliography with Author-Year Citation in `preamble.tex`:
	
        \RequirePackage[round, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}


### Nomenclature Definition

* To use nomenclature in your chapters:

        \nomenclature[g-pi]{$\pi$}{ $\simeq 3.14\ldots$}
	        
    The sort keys have prefix. In this case a prefix of `g` is used to denote Greek Symbols, followed by `-pi` or `-sort_key`. Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes. The standard prefixes defined in this class are:

    * `A` or `a`: Roman Symbols

    * `G` or `g`: Greek Symbols

    * `Z` or `z`: Acronyms/Abbreviations

    * `R` or `r`: Superscripts

    * `S` or `s`: Subscripts

    * `X` or `x`: Other Symbols

*   You can change the Title of Nomenclature to Notations or Symbols in the `preamble.tex` using:

        \renewcommand\nomname{Symbols}

## General guidelines
[Why is it important to follow good practices and not get killed by a Velociraptor ;)](http://www.xkcd.com/292/)

*   To restrict the length of the figure caption in List of figures use a \[short-title\] and {longtitle} for the caption or the section:

		`\caption[Caption that you want to appear in TOC]{Actual caption of the figure}`
		`\section[short]{title}`

*   To exclude sections from being numbered and disable it from appearing in the Table of Contents use \section*{Section_Name} or \chapter*{Chapter_Name}

*   To only exclude it from being listed in the Table of Contents encapsulate the section command inside the `\tochide` command. `\tochide{\section{Section_Name}}` the section will not appear in the Table of Contents, but the section will be numbered.

*   When including figures in your tex file, it's a good practice to size your picture depending on the page size, instead of using absolute values. In the following example `0.75\textwidth` refers to picture width being set to 75% of the text width.

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{minion}

*   Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes, eg., `g-pi` dentes the Greek symbol `pi`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Troubleshooting Warnings

### _W1_: I get the LaTeX Warning: You have requested document class Classes/PhDThesisPSnPDF, but the document class provides PhDThesisPSnPDF, should I be concerned? 

No! Do nothing, or if you don't want any warning messages change the line near the top of the class file to \ProvidesClass{Classes/PhDthesisPSnPDF} if you're not going to install the class file in a more standard location. You can install it in a standard location like `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/` and run `texhash` to reconfigure.

### _W2_:I get the package Fancyhdr Warning: \fancyhead's `E` option without twoside option is useless on input line \# or \#. What should I do? 

Nothing. The warning is because the twoside option is also defined in the class, although only the oneside option is currently used. 

### _W3_: I get the Class PhDThesisPSnPDF Warning: Unknown or non-standard option 'something'. Will see if I can load it from the book class. If you get a warning unused global option(s): `something` then the option is not supported! on input line \#.

You are either trying to use a undefined option or a non-standard option which is in the book class but not defined in the PhD Thesis Template. If it can be used it will be loaded and you will get no further warnings. If not, the option you chose is unavailable. 


### _W4_: I get LaTeX Warning: Unused global option(s):[something].

You are trying to load an option that is not supported in the PhDThesisClass and the Book Class. Are you sure you are using the right option? Check your spelling!

### _W5_: I get I'm skipping whatever remains of this command line \# of file thesis.aux \@input{Chapter1/chapter1.aux}

If you are generating a separate abstract for your thesis submission, ignore this warning and good luck with your submission. If you are compiling your thesis and see this warning, please remove the option `abstract` from the document class.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issue(s) / Bugs

*   Hyperlinks doesn't seem to be working in Post-Script file, however works on DVI and PDF (which is produced from the PS file), possibly viewer limitation than a code bug.

*   On older versions of dvips (version 5.97 or below), if your page margins do not appear properly in your PDF, when compiling through DVI >> PS >> PDF, please ensure that you have set a4paper or a5paper in the document class. If you are still having issues you can run:

		ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 thesis.ps thesis.pdf

    This issue occurs only when the papersize is not specified in the document class and you are compiling DVI >> PS >> PDF using an older version (5.97 or below) of dvips.

*   If you find any let me know, or even better, patch it and contribute to the development of the LaTeX Template.
